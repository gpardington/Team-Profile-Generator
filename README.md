  ## Description
  This is a command line application that generates ateam profile which includes the emmployee's role, name, email address, GitHub username, office number, and school attended based off the employee's role. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

  ### Installation
  The user can fork this repository and load it to their local machine. Once this is completed, the user will need to run a "npm i" in order to make the app functionable. This will be done in the integrated terminal.

  ### Usage 
  Once the application has been loaded to the user's machine, the user will run command "node app.js" in the integrated terminal at the root directory. Then, the user will be prompted with a series of questions. First, they will need to select the role of the employee they are wanting to add, then they will enter the employee's name, ID number, email address, and a couple other questions that are role specific. After the user has entered all of the employees, they can select, "No, I am finished adding employees," and an HTML page will be automatically generated.

  Here is a demo of the application:
